      <h1>Areas of Expertise</h1>
      <p>I gained the titles of Jedi Knight and Jedi Master during the past years. During my training years, I learned several
        forms of lightsaber combat, especially Form III. I faced some of the
        most dangerous people in the galaxy, such as the deadly Sith Lord Darth Maul and infamous Jedi Hunter General Grievous
        I was also a skilled pilot. In many ways, I represented the strength of the old Jedi Order: steadfast, selfless, and
        modest.
